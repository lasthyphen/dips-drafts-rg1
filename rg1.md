## Specification

### Motivation

This subproposal is for the inclusion of monthly face to face DGC meetings within the monthly governance cycle. The recommendation is that this monthly meeting is held on the first Wednesday of each month (and the first Wednesday of the Governance Cycle) to enable all DGC to meet and discuss any matters arising prior to the DIP formal submission window opens. This allows for discussion on any topic that may have been posted as a sentiment check, but also explores other opportunities amongst Council Members on the future and developments of Dijets Inc.

### Relevant Information

The proposal is for a structured council meeting which will include an Agenda and Minutes. It will allow for DGC Members to add matters arising to the agenda for discussion as well as provide a space for open discussion, innovation and future planning. It will provide a forum for Core Dijets updates to be shared with the Council where appropriate and for continued growth and knowledge of the Dijets Ecosystem to be gained. 
As there is a process to follow through the existing Governance Cycle for voting on proposals, this meeting does not have to be of 100% attendance at all times, however to enable discussion to be fair amongst members, the meetings should go ahead with no less than 75% of the DGC in attendance. 
The meeting will be held on the first Wednesday of the Governance Cycle between 16:00 â€“ 18:30.
